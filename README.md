### **Authentication**

**CareerPath** uses secure and reliable authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the platform. The authentication system is designed with both security and user experience in mind.

#### **Key Authentication Features:**

1. **JWT-based Secure Authentication**:  
   - **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are used to manage user sessions securely. After a user successfully logs in, a JWT token is issued, which they can use for authenticated requests. This token is stored securely on the client side (typically in localStorage or cookies).
   - JWT tokens ensure that each request from the client to the server is authenticated, providing a seamless and secure experience.

2. **Email Verification**:  
   - Users must register with a valid email address, and they will receive an email with a verification link to confirm their identity. This verification process helps ensure that the email provided is correct and belongs to the user.

3. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
   - The platform implements **role-based access control** to ensure that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles.
   - Common roles include:
     - **General User**: Regular access to job listings, course recommendations, profile management, etc.
     - **Admin**: Full access to the admin panel for managing user activity, job market insights, content moderation, etc.

4. **Password Security**:  
   - Passwords are securely stored using **bcrypt** hashing, ensuring that passwords are not exposed in their raw form.
   - Users can reset their passwords through a secure email-based recovery process.

5. **Session Management**:  
   - The platform manages sessions using JWT tokens, ensuring that users stay logged in until they choose to log out.
   - Tokens are refreshed automatically before expiration to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - Session timeouts are implemented for added security, automatically logging out users after a specified period of inactivity.

6. **OAuth Integration (Future Enhancement)**:  
   - In the future, CareerPath may integrate **OAuth** to support additional authentication methods (e.g., Google or LinkedIn login) for increased flexibility.

#### **User Authentication Flow:**

1. **Sign-Up**:  
   - The user registers by providing their email, creating a password, and filling out basic details.
   - Upon successful registration, the system sends a verification email to the provided email address.
   
2. **Email Verification**:  
   - The user clicks the verification link in their email to confirm their identity.
   - Once verified, the user can log in to the platform using their email and password.

3. **Login**:  
   - After email verification, the user can log in using their credentials (email and password).
   - Upon successful login, the user receives a JWT token, which is used for further authentication in subsequent requests.

4. **Accessing Platform Features**:  
   - The system checks the JWT token in the user's request headers to authenticate them before allowing access to protected features like job matching, course recommendations, and AI-powered tools.
